# swift project: geometric shape drawing app

<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>
Welcome to another one of my swift project! This is an in-class project from course CSE 438 "Mobile Application Development" taught by professor Todd Sproull at Washington University in St.Louis.

Because this app is not published in appstore, in order to test and view its functionalities, please follow these steps:<br>
1. please ensure you have Xcode installed on your laptop<br>
2. if you have Xcode installed, please download the code from github, and you should see a folder for it in the directory you downloaded it to.<br>
3. Once you opened the folder, you should see a file called "JeffreyWang-Lab3.xcodeproj". Please click on it and the code will be opened in Xcode automatically.<br>
4. On the top-left side of your Xcode interface, there should be a triangular play button. Click on it and it'll launch an iPhone 13 Pro simulator for you which you can test the app on.<br>
5. Since this is a rapid prototype and there's no constraints setting in this project, please ensure that the simulator is set to "iPhone 13 Pro" for best UI display<br>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>
This project is a drawing app that allows users to draw geometric shapes of different colors and modify them in various ways to make some art happen. The app has five major functionalities, and I'll explain them one by one here:<br></p>
<p>
1. Draw:<br>
There are 3 tab bars at the bottom of the app's user interface. From top to bottom, the first tab bar offers 5 color options, the second one offers 3 shape options, and the third one offers 5 action options. To use the "draw" functionality, please click on the "draw" button on the third tab bar, and choose a color and shape you wish to draw using the first and second tab bars. Then when you click on the drawing area, a geometric shape will be drawn on the canvas.<br>
2. Move:<br>
To use the "move" functionality, please click on the "move" button on the third tab bar. Then, you can move the shape around on the canvas by dragging it around, or you can resize/rotate it by pinching the screen with two fingers. If you are testing this app with a simulator on a laptop and want to try the resize and rotate functions, please press and hold the option key, and you will see two grey circles appear on your simulator, which simulates the pinching gesture with two finger tips.<br>
3. Erase:<br>
To use the "erase" functionality, please click on the "erase" button on the third tab bar. Then, you can erase the shapes you created by clicking on them. If you wish to erase all shapes at once, please click the "x" button on the top-right of the interface, and all shapes you just drawn will be erased.<br>
4. Color:<br>
The "color" function allows users to change the color of an object that they already created. To use the "color" function, please click on the "color" button on the third tab bar. Then, select a color on the first tab bar that you wish the shape to turn into, and click on that shape on your canvas.<br>
5. Opacity:<br>
The "opacity" function allows users to change the opacity of an object that they already created. To use the "opacity" function, please click on the "opacity" button on the third tab bar. There is a slide bar above the three tab bars that controls the opacity(%) of the objects that the users click on when they are using the "opacity" function. Now, if you drag the slide bar to a desired position, which represents a certain percentile of opacity, then click on a object on the canvas, the opacity(%) of that object will be changed to the value you just selected.<br>
</p>
<p>
Please play with it and have fun! Also, because this app uses no database, everything you drawn will not be saved once the simulator is turned off. So in case you made some art you wish to save, be sure to take a screenshot to save the image locally.
